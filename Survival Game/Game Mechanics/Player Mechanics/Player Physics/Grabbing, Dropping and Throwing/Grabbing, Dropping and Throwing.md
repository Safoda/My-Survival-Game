### This is how it will work (only using "E" as example) 


- If player has no object in hand,  it will be possible to grab pickable object if presses down E .



- If player releases E and dropping mechanism is not activated (false), player will not drop object.



- If object is in hand, pressing down E again will activate de dropping mechanism (true).



If dropping mechanism is activated player can choose to:

- Drop: Player will only drop object if player releases “E”, if object is being held and if dropping mechanism is activated (true).

- Throw: Player will only throw object, if player presses "LeftMouseButton", if object is being held and if dropping mechanism is activated (true).
