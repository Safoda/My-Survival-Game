## IDEA 1
### Interacting with objects

#### Picking objects (Tapping "E")


The idea:

Some objects are usable in the players hands, if the player taps "E" the object will snap into the Hand. 


#### Using the object in Hand 

The idea:

If the player presses "LeftClick", the object in Hand will be used.

#### Dropping object in hand

The idea:

If the player wants to drop the object in Hand, tap "g"








### Grabbing "Holding E"
A
The idea:


- 
- holding "E" for a certain amount of time will grab object
- object will snap to holding point
- player can rotate object using "R"
- releasing "E" will drop the object



## IDEA 2 (radial menu)


### Interacting with objects

#### Picking objects (Holding "E")
- When raycast detects an object, player can hold "E" to show a Radial Menu.
- This Radial Menu will have a few options depending on the object:
	- **Pick Up**
	- Consume
	- Open/Close baskets
	- Remove item from basket?
	- Etc...





#### Using the object in Hand 
After the player chooses the Pick Up option from the radial menu, the object will snap into the players Holding Point.  


#### Dropping object in hand
If the player wants to drop the object in Hand, tap "g"

### Grabbing (Holding "Left Mouse Button")
The idea:


The idea: Like the amnesia games, player can grab objects with "Left Mouse". Also open doors, levers and buttons





## Physics

### Actions


#### Walking
See:

Player will move with WASD and look around with mouse

#### Crouching
See:

Ctrl is the default key to crouch


#### Running
See:

Shift is the default key to run


#### Grabbing
See:[[Grabbing_ Dropping and Throwing]]




#### Dropping (Items)
See:[[Grabbing_ Dropping and Throwing]]




#### Throwing
See:[[Grabbing_ Dropping and Throwing]]




#### Using Item
See:[[Using Item]]




##### Use Weapon/Tool
##### Eating
##### Drinking
#### Climbing?

# Crafting
### Tool Durability
# Building
### Shelter
# Cooking
## Conserving food
**Drying**
**Smoking**
**Salting (if you have salt or seawater)**


🐟 Bonus: Preserving Fish on an Island

1. Gut it immediately
    
2. Rinse with clean seawater
    
3. Salt or brine it
    
4. Dry it in the sun or smoke it
    
5. Store in a **sealed basket or coconut husk**, away from moisture

## ❗Food to Eat Quickly (Hard to Preserve)

- Raw fruits (except bananas, coconuts)
    
- Fresh-caught shellfish (unless cooked immediately)
    
- Leafy greens
    
- Eggs (can last ~1 week in shade if unwashed

# Taming 

# Weather Mechanics



## Grabbing, Dropping and Throwing ("E" as an example)

- Player will be able to grab “pickable” object if presses down E.
- If player releases E and dropping mechanism is not activated (false), player will not drop object.
- If object is in hand, pressing down E will activate de dropping mechanism (true).
- If dropping mechanism is activated player can choose to:
- Drop: Player will only drop object if player releases “E”, if object is being held and if dropping mechanism is activated (true).
- Throw: Player will only throw object, if player presses LeftMouseButton, if object is being held and if dropping mechanism is activated (true).


## Inventory System

## Baskets

Baskets will allow the player to handle more items around the map:

- Player will craft baskets to be able to transport items around
- Baskets made out of rattan leaves

## Wheelbarrow

Wheelbarrow will allow the player to insert:

- Baskets (from empty to full)
- Logs
- Sticks
- Leaves

# Journal

📘 **Field Journal / Auto-notes** - Record discoveries: edible plants, recipes, animal tracks, star patterns

**Mystery Ingredient System** - Unknown plants must be tested or mixed — can produce surprises or disasters

Learn by experience — e.g., first contact with poison plant adds to survival journal

👣 **Memory-Based Mapping** - Map reveals only places the player remembers well — fog returns over time




# 🥲TO ORGANIZE (ideas):

#### ideas
Hurricanes, flash floods, monsoon cycles


Uncover remains of past islanders, ancient ruins

🐾**Animal Tracking** - Follow footprints, broken foliage, or sounds to find prey or avoid predators

🔍 **Secret Biomes** -  Volcanic areas, glowing caves, ancient ruins, coral labyrinths

🎭 **Hallucinations & Dreams** - Nightmares, spirit animals, or memories blur reality

🧘 **Calming Actions** - Music, meditation, or painting can restore emotional balance

📝 **Journaling as Therapy** - Writing down thoughts improves clarity and may lead to gameplay insights








#### 🌱 Ecosystem Simulation Mechanics

🌳 Tree Growth & Replanting - Cutting down trees without planting new ones changes climate or causes erosion




#### ⚔️ Combat & Defense Mechanics



🪤 **Trap Crafting** - Snares, spike pits, alarms — defend base or hunt animals

🐍 **Wildlife Aggression Levels** - Animals may be defensive, predatory, or neutral depending on behavior

💀 **Permadeath / Legacy System** - If you die, your next survivor can find your old camp, journal, and gear

👥 **Tribal Conflict or Factions** (if lore allows) - Defend against or ally with other humans — adds complexity
